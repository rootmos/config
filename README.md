# My configuration bucket

Containing a lot of scripts and sometimes useful configuration snippets I've collected over the years.
In the process of being split up into smaller repositories:
* [scripts](https://git.sr.ht/~rootmos/scripts)
* [continuously](https://github.com/rootmos/continuously)
* [dot-nvim](https://git.sr.ht/~rootmos/dot-nvim)
* [dot-nvim](https://git.sr.ht/~rootmos/media)
